# Instructions for running the Cleaning & Getting Data Project

To run the run_analysis.R file...

1. place it in the UCI HAR Dataset directory, or location where test & train directories are. Ensure that directory structure was retained on extraction.
2. ensure you have the working directory set to the directory where the data set & R script are.
3. open the file in R - using the source command, source("run_analysis.R"), you may need to specify a full path depending on the os you run
4. the file should run through to completion- wait for it to say 'Finished.'
5. the file should then be available
